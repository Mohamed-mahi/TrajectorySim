# TrajectorySim

A simulation program to model particle trajectories under a potential energy surface (PES) using the velocity Verlet algorithm. This program demonstrates energy-driven diffusion and thermal effects, specifically for graphene-on-graphene systems.

## Features
- Simulates particle trajectories under a PES.
- Incorporates the velocity Verlet algorithm to solve equations of motion.
- Visualizes trajectories overlaid on a PES colormap.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd TrajectorySim
